  	<title>UCB General METS Profile Version 1</title>
	<abstract>The UC Berkeley Library uses this profile to govern METS instance documents intended for submission to the California Digital Library as well as METS documents intended for reference use and dissemination to end users through UCB's own digital library repository.  The digital content governed by the METS documents conforming to this profile may be of any type or combination of types including, but not limited to: images, tei-based structured text, ocr-based unstructured text, pdf documents, ps documents, quicktime video, and Real audio. Source materials whose METS encoded digital versions would be covered by this profile could include manuscripts (such as letters and diaries), printed materials (such as books, pamphlets, and technical reports), mixed content materials (such as scrapbooks, photoalbums and oral histories that include photographs and/or sound recordings), individual photographs, paintings, sculptures, etc.  This profile also covers born-digital materials intended for general reference use. It at once extends, and for UC Berkeley Library purposes, completely supersedes the UCB Paged Text Object Profile and the UCB Imaged Object Profile. However, it is not in all respects backwards compatible with these profiles.</abstract>

	  		<description>
	  			<p>These are the supported values for &lt;file&gt; and &lt;fileGrp&gt; USE attributes in METS documents implementing this profile. They are intended mainly to help presentation programs know how they should treat particular content files.  In particular, they should help a presentation program distinguish between content files that are intended for reference use and those that  served as masters, but which are not intended for reference purposes.  They can also provide a presentation program with information that can help it or the end user decide what is the most appropriate content file for a particular purpose when this information is not apparent from the content file's MIME type.  For example, the USE attribute can help identify TEI encoded files and to distinguish these from other structured text files.  They allow presentation programs to recognize files with a MIME type of  &quot;text/plain&quot; which represent &quot;dirty&quot; OCR. The individual USE attribute values are defined below</p>
	  			<p>&quot;image/master&quot;, &quot;image/reference&quot;, &quot;image/thumbnail&quot; and &quot;image/dynamic&quot; are appropriate values to describe the intended use of image content files from a presentation program's standpoint. The value &quot;image/master&quot; designates image master files (ultimate or intermediate) not intended for reference use.  The appropriate USE values for any image that is intended for reference use, even if it also serves master image for other derivatives, would be &quot;image/reference&quot;, &quot;image/thumbnail&quot; or &quot;image/dynamic&quot;.  The value &quot;image/thumbnail&quot; designates images intended for  thumbnail applications; the value &quot;image/dynamic&quot;designates still images such as mrsid and jpeg2000 images which allow for zooming and other dynamic capabilities; and the more general value &quot;image/reference&quot; designates all other types of still image content files which are intended for general reference use</p>
	  			<p>&quot;text/tei&quot; and &quot;text/tei element&quot; are the  appropriate values to describe associated structured text files encoded according to TEI rules.  &quot;text/tei element&quot; applies when a &lt;file&gt; element represents just an element within an integral TEI content file. In this case, the xlink:href value in the &lt;FLocat&gt; element would use XPointer syntax to qualify the file URL and specify the ID attribute value of the relevant element in the TEI file.  &quot;text/tei&quot; applies to all &lt;file&gt; elements that represent integral TEI content files.</p>
	  			<p>&quot;text/ocr&quot; designates versions of the text produced by ocr technologies, but which have not been cleaned, and hence may not be appropriate for some purposes. &quot;text/reference&quot; designates unstructured text, including clean ocr, which is appropriate for reference and presentation purposes.</p>  			
	  			<p>&quot;application&quot; designates all types of non-video and non-audio content files encoded in a proprietary format requiring special browser plugins or players for presentation to the user.  This is the appropriate USE attribute value for &quot;pdf&quot; and &quot;ps&quot; content files .</p>
	  			<p>Audio content files are represented by two USE values: &quot;audio/master&quot; for audio master or archive files not intended for general reference use; and &quot;audio/reference&quot; for audio files suitable for general reference use.</p>
	  			<p>Video content files are also represented by two USE values: &quot;video/master&quot;; for video master or archive files not intended for general reference use;  and &quot;video/reference&quot; for video files suitable for general reference use</p>

	    		<p>&lt;fptr&gt; elements that reference images representing different manifestions (resolutions) of the same content must appear consecutively under the &lt;div&gt; to which they pertain.

    			<p>The &lt;mptr&gt; element, if it is used, must contain an xlink:href attribute, as well as a LOCTYPE attribute indicating the type of href being provided.  It may, but need not contain, any of the other attributes defined in the xlink:simpleLink attribute group as well as a CONTENTIDS attribute. No guidelines are provided, however, for the use of these attributes.</p>
    		</requirement>

				<p>An &lt;fptr&gt; element must either 1) directly point to a &lt;file&gt; element via its FILEID attribute; or 2) contain an &lt;area&gt; element that points to a &lt;file&gt; element; or 3) contain a &lt;seq&gt; element comprising multiple &lt;area&gt; elements that point to the relevant &lt;file&gt; elements. METS documents implementing this profile must not use the &lt;par&gt; element.   Typically the &lt;seq&gt; element would only be used under a &lt;div&gt; element that represented an intellectual (or logical) division, such as a diary entry.  In this case, more than one content file, played in sequence, may be required to manifest the logical division. 
				</p>
	      	</requirement>
	      	<requirement ID="structMap11">
	      		<p>An &lt;fptr&gt; element could directly contain an &lt;area&gt; element if only a portion of an integral file manifested the parent &lt;div&gt;.  This profile supports such use of the &lt;area&gt; element in conjunction with structured text, audio and video content only and as follows. 1) Structured text content. If an &lt;fptr&gt; element represents just a portion of an integral structured text file (such as  a TEI file),  an &lt;area&gt; element under the &lt;fptr&gt; would point to the  &lt;file&gt; element representing the integral structured text document (via its FILEID attribute) and would at least indicate the starting point of the relevant section of the content file via the &lt;area&gt; BEGIN attribute. The BEGIN attribute, in this case, would have a BETYPE of &quot;IDREF&quot;. The &lt;area&gt; element might also express the end point of the relevant section of the referenced file via its END attribute, but it need not do so. 2) Audio and video content. If an &lt;fptr&gt; element represents just a segment of an  integral audio or video content file, then  the &lt;area&gt; element under the &lt;fptr&gt; should point to the  &lt;file&gt; element representing the integral audio or video file (via its FILEID attribute) and must indicate the starting point and duration of the relevant section of the referenced audio or video file via the &lt;area&gt; BEGIN  and EXTENT attributes. The BETYPE and EXTTYPE attributes in these cases must be &quot;TIME&quot;  and the BEGIN and EXTENT attributes must contain a simple time value in the format HH:MM:SS.  If the relevant extent from the specified BEGIN point is the remainder of the audio or video file, then the EXTENT and EXTTYPE atributes may be omitted.</p>

	    			<p>An &lt;area&gt; element in documents implementing this profile should not use the SHAPE, COORDS or ADMID attributes.  It may, but need not, contain a CONTENTIDS attribute; however this profile provides no guidelines or rules for the use of this attribute</p>
	    		</requirement>
	    		<requirement ID="structMap13">
	    			<p> An &lt;fptr&gt;; element representing a content type other than structured text, audio or video in conforming documents can only reference integral content files. METS documents conforming to this profile must not use the &lt;area&gt; element with its associated BEGIN and END attributes to isolate internal segments of such content files. An &lt;fptr&gt; element could, however , under some circumstances, contain &lt;area&gt; elements, providing these &lt;area&gt; elements reference integral content files.  For example, an &lt;fptr&gt; element would contain a &lt;seq&gt; element with multiple child &lt;area&gt; elements if multiple files needed to be&quot;played&quot; in sequence to manifest a division.  This might be the case if the &lt;structMap&gt; expressed a logical structure and a &lt;div&gt; in that structure required several files to manifest it.  For example, the &lt;div&gt; elements in the &lt;structMap&gt; for a diary might represent diary entries; and some of these entries might span multiple physical pages, and hence require multiple page image content files to manifest them. In this case, the &lt;div&gt; representing the spanned diary entry would contain at least one &lt;fptr&gt;element; this &lt;fptr&gt; element would contain a &lt;seq&gt; element which in turn contained a separate &lt;area&gt; element pointing to each &lt;file&gt; element representing a page the diary entry spans.</p>

							<mods:abstract>This report discusses a VLSI implementation of a record-sorting stack. Records are represented on the stack as (key, record-pointer) pairs, and the operations supported are PUSH, POP, and CLEAR. When records are POPed, they are returned in smallest-first order. The implementation allows the sorting of n records in O(n) time, and the design is cascadable so that the capacity of a single VLSI chip does not limit the amount of data which may be sorted. This report describes a paper design and evaluation, and thus serves two purposes:  It describes one particular VLSI sorting circuit, and it also serves as a case study in VLSI design methodology. The algorithm is described, the overall chip organization and data flow are presented, and detailed circuits, layouts, and timing analyses are given</mods:abstract>
