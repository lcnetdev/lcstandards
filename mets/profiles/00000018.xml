	<abstract>
This profile describes the rules and requirements for using METS as an exchange format to support the collection and preservation of and access to content in Australian digital repositories. It is a generic profile not specific to a particular system or implementation. Repositories will need to develop and register sub-profiles that detail implementation-specific requirements.

	<description_rules>
		<p>This profile describes the rules and requirements for using METS as an exchange format to support the collection and preservation of and access to content in Australian digital repositories. It is a generic profile not specific to a particular system or implementation, and therefore does not, for example, contain any detail in the Technical Requirements section. It is intended that repositories will develop and register sub-profiles that detail the implementation-specific requirements.</p>
		<p>Saying that a particular element or attribute in this profile is not supported does not imply that it is prohibited. However, it does imply that it may be ignored. In general, implementations processing METS documents that conform to this profile should attempt to preserve any undefined elements or attributes. </p>
		<p>A conforming METS document represents a discrete object of interest for the purposes of collection, preservation or access. An object will be completely described in a conforming METS document, therefore in the case of a composite object, the components will be described within the document as well. </p>
		<p>An object (whether it is a single or composite object) may be a component of another object. A conforming METS document may therefore represent a whole object or a component, as long as the component is a discrete object of interest with its own descriptive metadata.  </p>
		<p>Where an object is a component of another object, a conforming METS document should express that relationship through appropriate elements in the descriptive metadata extension schema, i.e. self-referencing, either fully described in the primary MODS, or in separate &#60;dmdSec&#62; elements.</p>
		<p>An object or component described in a conforming METS document may be a physical object that has not yet have been digitised or it may be a digital object stored on a physical carrier.   </p>
		<p>The amount of data included in a conforming METS document will depend on the purpose of the document. If the purpose is to submit an object to a repository as an OAIS Submission Information Package (SIP), then a conforming METS document must contain the files comprising the archival copy of the object and its components. If the purpose is to transfer custody of an object from one repository to another as an OAIS Archival Information Package (AIP), it must also contain the supporting files and metadata necessary for the object's long term preservation and access.  If the purpose is to deliver an object as an OAIS Dissemination Information Package (DIP), a conforming METS document may contain only derivative files or pointers to derivative files, along with sufficient metadata to render or execute these files properly. In the case of complex hierarchical objects, components may be represented by another METS document and just referenced in the parent METS document.</p>
<p>The first example appended to this profile shows a submission information package for a digitised still image with two files comprising the archival copy of the object (master and co-master). The &#60;dmdSec&#62; contains only identifiers for the still image and its host collection as these can be used by the repository to retrieve a full cataloguing record on ingest. There is no technical metadata for the images themselves as this can be generated on ingest. However, PREMIS &#60;object&#62;, &#60;event&#62; and &#60;agent&#62; metadata elements are included because of the need to record the derivation relationship, the hardware and software used in the creation events and the type of manipulation used to create the co-master.</p>
		<p>The second example appended to this profile shows a dissemination information package that could be used to transfer a digitised still image from the same collection from one repository to another. The package includes a derivative master and two derivative files created on ingest as well as the master and co-master. Seven events are recorded, the creation events for each file and the ingestion events for the master and co-master.</p>
		<p>Information encoded using the extension schema listed in this profile should follow the appropriate guidelines recommended by the extension schema's maintenance agencies. For example, MODS encoded descriptive metadata should follow the MODS Users Guidelines published by the Library of Congress' Network Development and MARC Standards Office.  Users of additional schema should list these as extension schema in a sub-profile and follow the appropriate guidelines.  </p>
		<p>All available metadata should be included for the archival copy of an object when custody is being transferred. If no suitable extension schema covers all the metadata, the extra elements can be encoded using a local extension schema.</p>
		<p>Controlled vocabularies for elements that are mandatory in this profile and that are not already included in METS or the registered extension schema are listed in the Controlled Vocabularies section. Users of additional elements constrained by controlled vocabularies should list these in the Controlled Vocabularies section of a sub-profile.</p>
		<p>Values of "not applicable" and "unknown" are permitted for mandatory elements and attributes where data cannot be supplied.</p>

			<requirement ID="amdSec20">
				<p>Each PREMIS Event must have values encoded for all mandatory elements (&#60;eventIdentifier&#62;, &#60;eventType&#62;, &#60;eventDateTime&#62;).  For PREMIS &#60;eventType&#62; use values from the Australian METS Profile Event Type controlled vocabulary.

Each &#60;fileGrp&#62; must contain at least one &#60;file&#62; belonging to that USE category. Values have not been included in this vocabulary for services that deliver access to an object because it is assumed that these would not be included in a Submission Information Package or Dissemination Information Package. Such a service may be archived as an object in its own right, in which case the &#60;fileGrp&#62; would have a USE attribute of "original". This decision may be reviewed if a use case emerges that requires a service USE attribute.

				<p>There may be a variety of different types of derivative (thumbnail, view, examination, streaming, special delivery). Within each of these types there may be multiple sub-types, e.g., two different-sized thumbnails, one for result sets, one for display with the descriptive metadata. At this stage it is assumed that the derivative &#60;fileGrp&#62; will contain all of the derivative files needed for the successful delivery of an object.  Within the derivative &#60;fileGrp&#62;, the &#60;file&#62; USE attribute may be used in order to distinguish between the different types of derivatives.  Values for the &#60;file&#62; USE attribute must be drawn from a controlled vocabulary, which must be specified in a sub-profile.  The Behaviors section of the sub-profile must also detail the different types of derivatives included in the &#60;fileGrp&#62;, and associate them with appropriate behaviours for each &#60;structMap&#62; &#60;div&#62; TYPE.

The &#60;file&#62; CHECKSUMTYPE attributes must contain values from the controlled vocabulary specified in METS.  This profile requires MIMETYPE, SIZE, CHECKSUM and CHECKSUMTYPE to be recorded as METS &#60;file&#62; attributes rather than as equivalent elements in a &#60;techMD&#62; &#60;premisObject&#62; instance because providing this information at the packaging level enables processing decisions to be made without having to parse the package payload, and potentially allows for a more modular design of processors.
